Hi there! This is Kshitij!

I currently work with Milliman Inc. as a data scientist/ ML engineer. At Milliman, I lead  machine-learning efforts in actuarial sciences. Specifically, I apply statistical learning to model lapses and surrenders for life-insurance policies. I am also a visualization geek, so I lead dashboard development in [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and am keenly interested in [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). I also lead efforts in areas of [DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) and [DevSecOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops).

I am a [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) grad and my academic interests are leveraging big data tools to develop scalable statistical machine learning methods in areas of computer vision and healthcare. I am a contributor on the [CheXpert] (https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) project.

I also frequently contribute to open source software for statistical learning and data visualization.

My goals are making a dent in the world by advancing the current state of the art in deep-learning.
Oh and I also talk frequently at industry conferences. Catch me next in Zurich, where I am going to talk at the [Insurance data science conference](https://insurancedatascience.org/).
